Project made in 3 days.
Consists of two parts:
1)guitar note recognition up to 4th fret
2)note drawing on notesheet

1)6 green string, if any of them is played open, corresponding one turns blue. If any fret is played a blue dot appears on corresponding one

2)5 lines like in classic notesheet. Can hold up to 8 played notes, then can be cleared by key[2]. The concept is, if, let's say, C note is played, it appears on screen as an ellipse. Then if we play other(or even 
the same ) note, it will appear on the right side of first played note(the first note is not lost, it still hangs there). And so up to 8 notes. 

Can switch from 1) to 2) by key[0] and key[1] respectively.

1)works 50/50
2)doesn't want to
